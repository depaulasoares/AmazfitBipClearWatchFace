# AmazfitClearWatchFace
 Yep, just another watchface for [Amazfit Bip](https://en.amazfit.com/bip-lite.html).

 ## Why?
 I want a *clear*, simples, functional, good looking watchface for my Bip Lite. One that I can at-a-glance see what is really important to me:
 - Time on format HH:MM;
 - Date with weekday, month and day;
 - Battery: small but readable and meaningful representation;
 - Steps;
 - Heart rate;

 ## Tools:
 - [Amazfit Central Watchface Reference](https://amazfitcentral.com/2018/02/05/amazfit-bip-watchface-reference-including-some-json-docs/);
 - Application [AmazfitBip WF Editor](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/3o37tsmbbh5u3/Amazfit_Bip_Editor_-_Stable#qr2m99j209ghb) from [Forum GIZCHINA.it - Beep WF Editor by ilGruppo Tester](https://forum.gizchina.it/index.php?/topic/1489-bip-wf-editor-by-ilgruppotester/);
