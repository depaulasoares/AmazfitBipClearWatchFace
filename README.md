# AmazfitClearWatchFace
 Yep, just another watchface for [Amazfit Bip](https://en.amazfit.com/bip-lite.html).
 
 ## Why?
 I want a *clear*, simples, functional, good looking watchface for my Bip Lite. One that I can at-a-glance see what is really important to me:
 - Time on format HH:MM;
 - Date with weekday, month and day;
 - Battery: small but readable and meaningful representation;
 - Steps;
 - Heart rate;

 ## Tools:
 - [AmazfitBipTools](https://bitbucket.org/valeronm/amazfitbiptools/src/master/);
 - [Watchface Editor](https://github.com/v1ack/watchfaceEditor).

## Project Changelog
- [Here you can see project status/changelog](changelog.md).


 And, that's all folks!
